DESCRIPTION OF TASK :
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of customer reviews for musical instruments using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on textual content.

Dataset-
The dataset used is Musical_instruments_reviews.csv.
It contains customer reviews and ratings for various musical instruments.
Missing values in the review text column are removed for data integrity.

Data Preprocessing :

1.Sentiment Labeling:
Ratings are converted into sentiment labels:

-Positive: Ratings of 4 and 5

-Neutral: Rating of 3

-Negative: Ratings of 1 and 2

2.Text Cleaning:

-Convert text to lowercase.

-Remove non-alphabetic characters.

-Remove extra whitespace.

Feature Extraction :

-TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to transform the processed text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training :

1.Algorithm: Logistic Regression

2.Data Split: Training and testing sets

3.Evaluation Metrics:

-Accuracy Score

-Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Usage :

1.Load the dataset.

2.Preprocess the text and assign sentiment labels.

3.Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF.

4.Train the logistic regression model.

5.Evaluate the model performance.
